# Small-scale Technology Certificate (STC) Intake Platform

This repository tracks the design for a web platform that lets solar panel and battery installers assign their rights to create Small-scale Technology Certificates (STCs) to your company. The platform focuses on collecting compliant installation data, validating it against Clean Energy Regulator (CER) requirements, and capturing supporting evidence (photos and video) for streamlined STC creation.

## What’s here

- **Product overview** with the key user journeys.
- **Requirements and compliance scope** describing data capture, validations, and evidence handling.
- **Architecture outline** covering the compliance engine, OCR pipeline, and storage considerations.

See [`docs/requirements.md`](docs/requirements.md) for detailed functional requirements and [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for a proposed system design.
